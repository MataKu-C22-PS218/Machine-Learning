Machine Learning team is responsible to:
- Collect and organize objects dataset
- Create an object classification model
- Train the model to get the best accuracy.

The model is created using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), that is most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. We create our own model architecture and also we use the pre-trained model from Transfer Learning such as InceptionV3 and VGG16.
From some models above, the best model is InceptionV3 with 97,12% accuracy.

After being trained, we deploy the model to Android platform. We export the model in .tflite extension to deploy it to Android platform.
